Ways to improve:
1. Consider the Production Studio, as Marvel Studios' releases get a bigger opening, thereby a bigger gross regardless of ratings.
2. Consider the brand of the movie, as sequels get more than the previous entry in the franchise.
3. Preceeding and suceeding movies to event movies (Avengers, Spider-Man, Batman) get a benefit in opening.
4. Summer and Winter releases get a bigger opening on average.
